ï»¿# INF2008_ML
To use the project file, the team had used Jupyter Notebook to run the cell.

The team has sent in the .pkl model files through the Xsite together with the presentation slides and video as the size was too big for GitHub.

The same is for the cleaned_merged_dataset.csv, it has been linked inside the slides for you to download.

The file structure will be as follows

INF2008-Project-P3-G18.ipynb or INF2008-Project-P3-G18.py can be used, both file types were given just in case.

Models > .pkl for all the models
Multiclass_dataset > cleaned_merged_dataset.csv
