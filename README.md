To use the project file, the team had used Jupyter Notebook to run the cell.

The team has sen tin the .pkl model files through the Xsite together with the presentaion slides and video as the size was too big for GitHub.

The same is for the cleaned_merged_dataset.csv, it has been linked inside the slides for you to download.

The file structure will be as follows

final.ipynb
Models > .pkl for all the models
Multiclass_dataset > cleaned_merged_dataset.csv
